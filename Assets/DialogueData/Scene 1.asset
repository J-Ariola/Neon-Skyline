    sentences:
    - It was a cold night when they took her.
    - I remember trying to catch my breath in my hands, already numb from the cold.
    - Shattered glass...
    - Broken Chairs...
    - There was definitely a struggle here.
    - I thought we were safe here-
    - I thought I had escaped the Underground.
    - "I should have known it wouldn\u2019t have been so easy."
    - "I\u2019m a racer."
    - Well...
    - I used to be.
    - Back in the day, I used to race for some groups in order to make some money.
    - That's how they do things in the Underground.
    - They used to just fight each other for power and resources, but with the lack
      of police and regulation...
    - There was a lot of collateral.
    - We lost a lot of good people back then.
    - Now, they use racing.
    - "Didn\u2019t keep the killings from happening, but it helped."
    - "I didn\u2019t stick my nose into what they did, I just raced, got paid, and
      got out."
    - I thought I did at least.
    - "We didn\u2019t live in any sort of paradise..."
    - But it was warm, and we could call it home.
    - My daughter, Jessica, loved it.
    - "She doesn\u2019t remember the Underground, she was too young."
    - "It\u2019s better that way."
    - I want her to grow up better than I did.
    - None of that mattered at that point though...
    - As I called out her name that day...
    - An empty house standing before me.
    - The only thing left of her was a note on the counter...
    - An address...
    - And a set of keys.
