    - But the people too.
    - Kawashima Junction is a hub of transportation.
    - Means a lot of people would be watching.
    - "We thought we\u2019d miss the start of the race,"
    - The place is too big,
    - But once we showed up...
    - We realized that was impossible.

    - Hacking the roads at the previous races,
    - But this was different.
    - This was a show.
    - People stood on rooftops with binoculars, and crowded the street corners...
    - Watching...
    - Waiting...
    - Large aircraft loomed in the distance-
    - Most likely where the masterminds of this were lounging.
