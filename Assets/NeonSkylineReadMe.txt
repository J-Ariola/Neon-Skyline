How to drive the hovercar:
1. Use the "Right Trigger" of the controller to accelerate the hovercar.
2. Use the "Left Thumbstick" to turn the hovercar
3. Using the "Left Trigger" functions as the brakes for the hovercar.
        When the hovercar is no longer accelerating forward, using the "Left Trigger" also functions as the reverse.


Using the drift mechanic:
1. While accelerating the car, the player may use the brake to slow down the car and store potential energy into the car's thrusters. 
2. Upon releasing the brakes with potential energy stored, the cars then boosts until all the potential energy has been used up.


Tricks:
1. Using tricks in a race provides entertainment for the sponsors. Sponsors will then give a power up which provides the player and 'edge' in the race.
2. Each trick is associate with power up.
